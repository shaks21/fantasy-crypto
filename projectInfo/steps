Absolutely! I'll guide you step by step in building the Fantasy Crypto game within your Next.js app. Let's begin:

Step 1: Project Setup
1. Make sure you have Node.js and npm installed on your machine.
2. Clone your Next.js app repository to your local development environment.
3. Open a terminal or command prompt and navigate to the project directory.
4. Install the required dependencies by running the command: `npm install`

Step 2: Planning and Design
1. Define the rules and mechanics of the Fantasy Crypto game.
2. Design the user interface (UI) for the game screens, such as portfolios, market data, leaderboard, and matches. You can use tools like Figma or Sketch for UI/UX design.

Step 3: Implement Core Functionality
1. Create a new directory, let's call it `src`, within your project's root directory.
2. Inside the `src` directory, create subdirectories for different parts of the game's functionality, such as `components`, `pages`, `models`, and `utils`.
3. Implement the necessary data structures and models to represent cryptocurrencies, portfolios, leagues, and matches in the `models` directory.
4. Set up API integrations to fetch cryptocurrency data. You can use existing crypto data APIs or create simulated data within the `utils` directory.

Step 4: Develop User Interfaces
1. Start by creating React components within the `components` directory for different game screens.
2. Implement the UI for displaying portfolios, market data, leaderboard, and other relevant game screens.
3. Connect the components to the necessary data models and APIs to fetch and display the required information.

Step 5: Integration with Netlify
1. Ensure that your Netlify deployment settings are configured to automatically build and deploy changes from the desired branch whenever you push updates to your repository. Verify that your `netlify.toml` file contains the necessary settings.
2. Make sure your Git repository is connected to Netlify for automatic deployments.
3. Push your changes to the desired branch in your Git repository, and Netlify will automatically trigger a new build and deploy your updated app.

Step 6: Testing and Iteration
1. Regularly test your game's functionality and user interfaces to identify and fix any bugs or issues.
2. Gather feedback from users or beta testers and make improvements based on their suggestions.
3. Iterate on the design and features of the game based on feedback and testing.

Step 7: Deployment and Publishing
1. Once you have a functional and tested version of the game, commit and push the final changes to the repository.
2. Netlify will automatically build and deploy the latest version of your app based on your deployment settings.
3. Visit your Netlify app's URL to access and play the Fantasy Crypto game.
